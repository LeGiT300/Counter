# Counter
This counts thee number of people entering or leaving a particular area and displays the count on a seven segment LED display
The prrimary arduino library used here is SevSeg library. this library can be easily used to program the seven segment display.
The project was realized with Ultrasonic Sensor, seven segment display, an LED, arduino UNO and some jumper wires.
When an object passes infront of the ultrasonic sensor, it counts and the count is displayed on the sevensegment display.
the LED blinks the number of times an object has passed infront of the sensor
